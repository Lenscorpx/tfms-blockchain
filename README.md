# 🌐 TFMS-Blockchain
## 🚀 Overview 
**Blockchain-Powered Corruption Reporting System**   
**TFMS-Blockchain** is a decentralized, blockchain-powered system designed to fight corruption by providing a **tamper-proof, transparent, and censorship-resistant reporting platform**. It empowers whistleblowers, investigators, and watchdogs to **report, track, and audit corruption cases** without fear of manipulation or retaliation.

## ✅ Core Benefits  

- **Tamper-Proof Records**  
  Every report is immutably stored on-chain, ensuring it cannot be deleted, altered, or covered up by bad actors.  

- **Anonymity & Privacy**  
  Reports can be submitted pseudonymously using **zero-knowledge proofs** or privacy-focused blockchains like **Zcash**.  

- **Auditability**  
  Investigators and watchdogs can independently verify report integrity and monitor follow-up actions.  

- **Decentralized Hosting**  
  Eliminates the risk of censorship since no single authority controls the platform.  

- **Smart Contracts for Escalation**  
  Automated workflows can escalate cases or trigger alerts based on severity or volume of reports.

## 🌍 Real-World Inspiration  

- **Indonesia’s Public Procurement Blockchain**  
  Increased transparency in government contracts by logging bids and awards immutably.  

- **U4 Anti-Corruption Framework**  
  Recognizes blockchain’s role in governance where institutional trust is weak.  

- **World Economic Forum Recommendations**  
  Advocates blockchain for **procurement transparency**, **whistleblower protection**, and **open budgeting**.

## 🛠️ Architecture (Proposed)  

If deployed in **RDC** or similar contexts, the platform could follow this stack:  

- **Frontend** → [React](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a fast and user-friendly reporting interface.  
- **Backend** → [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for scalable APIs and blockchain integration.  
- **Storage** → [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) for decentralized file & evidence storage.  
- **Blockchain Layer** → Public chain (Ethereum / Polygon) or **permissioned chain** (Hyperledger) for sensitive data.  
- **Governance** → DAO-based oversight to ensure **community-driven trust and transparency**.
